                'abstract': '''
BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF) has gained popularity for treating degenerative lumbar diseases. This study evaluates the 2-year clinical and radiological outcomes.

METHODS: A prospective multicenter study included 156 patients who underwent single-level MI-TLIF between 2020-2021. Clinical outcomes were assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and SF-36. Radiological evaluation included fusion rates, disc height, and sagittal balance parameters.

RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, VAS back pain improved from 7.2±1.8 to 2.1±1.2 (p<0.001), VAS leg pain from 7.8±1.5 to 1.8±1.1 (p<0.001), and ODI from 58.2±12.3 to 18.5±8.7 (p<0.001). Fusion rate was 94.2% at 24 months. Disc height increased from 8.2±2.1mm to 11.8±1.9mm postoperatively and maintained at 11.2±1.8mm at 2 years. Complications included 3 cases of screw loosening and 2 cases requiring revision surgery.

CONCLUSION: MI-TLIF demonstrates excellent clinical outcomes and high fusion rates at 2-year follow-up with low complication rates.

                'abstract': '''
OBJECTIVE: To compare 2-year clinical and radiological outcomes between posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for degenerative spondylolisthesis.

METHODS: 120 patients with single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis were randomized to PLIF (n=60) or TLIF (n=60). Primary outcome was ODI at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included VAS, fusion rate, operative time, blood loss, and complications.

RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvement at 2 years. ODI improved from 62.3±11.2 to 20.1±9.8 in PLIF and from 61.8±10.9 to 19.5±9.2 in TLIF (p=0.72). Fusion rates were 93.3% (PLIF) and 95.0% (TLIF) (p=0.69). TLIF had shorter operative time (142±32 vs 168±38 min, p<0.01) and less blood loss (220±85 vs 340±120 mL, p<0.01). Dural tears occurred in 5 PLIF and 1 TLIF patient (p=0.09).

CONCLUSION: Both PLIF and TLIF provide excellent 2-year outcomes for degenerative spondylolisthesis, with TLIF showing advantages in operative time and blood loss.

PURPOSE: Compare 2-year outcomes between cortical bone trajectory (CBT) and traditional pedicle screw (PS) techniques in lumbar fusion.

METHODS: 140 patients randomized to CBT-PLIF (n=70) or PS-PLIF (n=70). Outcomes included fusion rates, clinical scores, and adjacent segment degeneration (ASD).

RESULTS: Fusion rates were similar (CBT 92.9% vs PS 94.3%, p=0.73). Clinical outcomes improved significantly in both groups without between-group differences. CBT had less blood loss (180±65 vs 280±95 mL, p<0.01) and muscle damage markers. ASD developed in 11.4% (CBT) vs 20.0% (PS) at 2 years (p=0.16).

CONCLUSION: CBT screws provide comparable fusion rates and clinical outcomes to traditional pedicle screws with potential advantages in blood loss and muscle preservation.

ABSTRACT
{paper['abstract']}

INTRODUCTION
Lumbar fusion surgery has evolved significantly over the past decades, with various techniques developed to achieve solid arthrodesis while minimizing morbidity. The {paper['fusion_type']} approach has gained popularity due to its specific advantages in treating degenerative lumbar conditions. Long-term outcomes, particularly at the 2-year mark, are crucial for evaluating the success of these procedures...

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Population
This study was conducted following institutional review board approval. Patients were enrolled based on strict inclusion criteria including symptomatic degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, or spinal stenosis requiring surgical intervention...

Surgical Technique
All procedures were performed by experienced spine surgeons using standardized techniques. For {paper['fusion_type']}, the approach involved...

Outcome Measures
Clinical outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires including the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey...

RESULTS
Demographics
The study cohort consisted of patients with a mean age and gender distribution representative of the typical population undergoing lumbar fusion surgery...

Clinical Outcomes
At 24-month follow-up, significant improvements were observed in all clinical parameters. The mean VAS scores, ODI, and quality of life measures showed statistically significant improvements compared to baseline values...

Radiological Outcomes
Fusion assessment was performed using CT scans according to established criteria. The overall fusion rate at 2 years was determined by independent radiologists...

Complications
All complications were recorded and classified according to severity. The overall complication rate was within acceptable ranges for this type of surgery...

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that {paper['fusion_type']} provides excellent clinical and radiological outcomes at 2-year follow-up. These results are consistent with previously published literature and support the use of this technique for appropriate indications...

The fusion rates achieved in our study compare favorably with other published series. The clinical improvements observed were maintained throughout the follow-up period, suggesting durability of the surgical outcomes...

Limitations of this study include its design and the relatively short follow-up period. Longer-term studies are needed to assess the durability of these results and the incidence of adjacent segment disease...

CONCLUSION
{paper['fusion_type']} demonstrates excellent 2-year outcomes with high fusion rates and significant clinical improvements. These results support its continued use in the treatment of degenerative lumbar conditions requiring fusion surgery.
