## Abstract

Transforaminal epidural steroid injection is traditionally performed under fluoroscopic guidance. However, ultrasound-guided transforaminal injection (USTFI) has emerged as a promising alternative offering several advantages:

- No radiation exposure
- No requirement for specialized procedure area  
- Equipment mobility and accessibility
- Real-time visualization of soft tissue structures and needle trajectory

This narrative review describes the indexed articles published on USTFI and ultrasound-guided selective nerve root block (SNRB) to evaluate current evidence on the best approach to perform the block.

## Key Findings

### 1. Technical Approaches

**Axial Approach**
- Probe placed perpendicular to the spine
- Good for visualizing transverse processes

**Parasagittal Approach**  
- Probe placed parallel to the spine
- Most commonly used in studies
- Better for following needle trajectory

**Combined Approach**
- Uses both orientations for optimal visualization
- May improve accuracy

### 2. Advantages of Ultrasound Guidance

- **Radiation Safety**: Complete elimination of radiation exposure for both patient and practitioner
- **Accessibility**: Can be performed at bedside or in any clinical setting
- **Real-time Imaging**: Dynamic visualization of needle advancement and surrounding structures
- **Vascular Safety**: Ability to identify blood vessels and avoid intravascular injection
- **Cost-effectiveness**: No need for specialized fluoroscopy suite

### 3. Limitations and Challenges

- **Acoustic Shadowing**: Difficulty visualizing needle tip due to bony structures blocking ultrasound waves
- **Learning Curve**: Requires specific training and experience
- **Limited Evidence**: Small sample sizes in most published studies
- **Depth Limitations**: Challenges in obese patients or deeper spinal levels
- **Lack of Standardization**: No consensus on optimal technique

### 4. Current Evidence Status

Through literature search, the review found:
- 8 articles and 1 case report on USTFI
- 5 articles on ultrasound-guided SNRB
- Most studies had small sample sizes
- Limited data on contrast spread patterns
- Accuracy rates reported around 90% when confirmed with fluoroscopy

## Conclusion

While ultrasound-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural injection shows promise as a radiation-free alternative to fluoroscopic guidance, the current evidence base remains limited. The technique offers clear advantages in terms of safety and accessibility, but requires further validation through larger studies.

The authors recommend:
1. Larger sample size studies
2. Standardized technique descriptions
3. Analysis of dye spread patterns
4. Comparison studies with fluoroscopic guidance
5. Long-term outcome assessments

"Further studies with larger sample size and description of dye spread patterns are recommended to come to a more definite conclusion."

## Clinical Implications

For practitioners considering USTFI:
- Adequate training is essential
- Consider using fluoroscopic confirmation initially
- Patient selection is important (avoid in obese patients initially)
- Combine approaches for optimal visualization
- Maintain awareness of technique limitations
