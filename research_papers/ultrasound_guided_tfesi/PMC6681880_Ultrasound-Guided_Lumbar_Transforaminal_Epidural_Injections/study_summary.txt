## Abstract

**Objective**: To investigate the success rate (technical precision) of ultrasound-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection by validating the results with conventional fluoroscopic technique.

## Methodology

### Study Design
- Prospective validation study
- Single center
- Fluoroscopic confirmation of ultrasound-guided technique

### Participants
- **Sample Size**: 20 patients
- **Inclusion Criteria**: Unilateral single-level lumbar foraminal disc protrusion
- **Exclusion Criteria**: Not specified in the summary

### Technical Approach
1. **Ultrasound Guidance**:
   - Used axial view for needle positioning
   - Real-time visualization during needle advancement
   - 22-gauge spinal needle

2. **Validation Method**:
   - Fluoroscopic confirmation after ultrasound-guided placement
   - Contrast dye injection to verify epidural spread
   - Assessment of technical accuracy

### Outcome Measures
- Primary: Technical accuracy rate (successful epidural placement)
- Secondary: Complication rates

## Results

### Overall Accuracy
- **Overall Success Rate**: 90% (18/20 patients)
- **Failed Cases**: 2 patients (10%)

### Success Rates by Spinal Level
| Level | Success Rate | Cases |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| L3-L4 | 100%        | All successful |
| L4-L5 | 80%         | 2 failures |
| L5-S1 | 100%        | All successful |

### Safety Profile
- **Complications**: None reported
- **Adverse Events**: 0%

### Technical Observations
- Both failed cases occurred at the L4-L5 level
- L5-S1 level showed the highest reliability
- No vascular punctures or nerve injuries

## Key Findings

### 1. Clinical Feasibility
- Ultrasound guidance is accurate and feasible in clinical settings
- 90% accuracy rate comparable to fluoroscopy-only techniques
- No specialized radiology suite required

### 2. Advantages Demonstrated
- **Radiation-Free**: Complete elimination of radiation exposure
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Dynamic needle tracking
- **Soft Tissue Imaging**: Better visualization of:
  - Nerve roots
  - Blood vessels
  - Surrounding muscles
- **Patient Positioning**: Can be performed in lateral decubitus position

### 3. Technical Considerations
- L4-L5 level may be more challenging
- Axial view provides adequate visualization
- Contrast validation confirms accurate placement

### 4. Clinical Implications
- Viable alternative to fluoroscopy-guided injections
- Particularly useful for:
  - Pregnant patients
  - Patients requiring multiple injections
  - Settings without fluoroscopy access

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=20)
- Single center study
- No long-term outcome data
- No comparison of clinical efficacy

## Conclusion

The study demonstrates that ultrasound-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural injections are "accurate and feasible in clinical setting with an accuracy of 90% and no complications." This technique offers a radiation-free alternative to traditional fluoroscopy-guided procedures while maintaining high technical success rates.

## Recommendations for Practice
1. Consider ultrasound guidance as first-line approach
2. Be aware of potential challenges at L4-L5 level
3. Use fluoroscopic backup if available for difficult cases
4. Ensure adequate training before implementation
