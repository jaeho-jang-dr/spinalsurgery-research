Abstract:

INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion represents the latest evolution in minimally invasive spine surgery. We report 2-year outcomes of this technique.

METHODS: 42 patients underwent endoscopic TLIF for single-level degenerative conditions. Clinical outcomes, fusion rates, and complications were assessed.

RESULTS: Mean operative time was 165±35 minutes, blood loss 50±25 mL, hospital stay 1.2±0.4 days. At 2 years, VAS improved from 7.3±1.4 to 1.8±0.9, ODI from 59.5±10.2 to 15.3±6.8 (p<0.001). Fusion rate was 90.5%. One patient had transient dysesthesia, one required revision for cage migration.

CONCLUSION: Endoscopic lumbar interbody fusion shows promising 2-year results with minimal tissue trauma, though longer follow-up and larger studies are needed.
