Abstract:

PURPOSE: Compare 2-year outcomes between cortical bone trajectory (CBT) and traditional pedicle screw (PS) techniques in lumbar fusion.

METHODS: 140 patients randomized to CBT-PLIF (n=70) or PS-PLIF (n=70). Outcomes included fusion rates, clinical scores, and adjacent segment degeneration (ASD).

RESULTS: Fusion rates were similar (CBT 92.9% vs PS 94.3%, p=0.73). Clinical outcomes improved significantly in both groups without between-group differences. CBT had less blood loss (180±65 vs 280±95 mL, p<0.01) and muscle damage markers. ASD developed in 11.4% (CBT) vs 20.0% (PS) at 2 years (p=0.16).

CONCLUSION: CBT screws provide comparable fusion rates and clinical outcomes to traditional pedicle screws with potential advantages in blood loss and muscle preservation.
