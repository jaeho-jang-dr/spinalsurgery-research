Abstract:

BACKGROUND: Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) with posterior instrumentation provides circumferential stability. This study reports 2-year minimum follow-up outcomes.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 89 patients who underwent ALIF with posterior percutaneous pedicle screw fixation from 2019-2021. Clinical outcomes (VAS, ODI, SF-12) and radiological parameters were evaluated.

RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 28.3±3.2 months. VAS back pain decreased from 6.9±1.7 to 1.9±1.1, ODI from 54.3±13.2 to 16.2±7.8 (both p<0.001). Lordosis improved from 38.2±12.1° to 52.3±10.8° and maintained at 51.8±10.5° at final follow-up. Fusion rate was 96.6%. Complications included 2 vascular injuries, 1 retrograde ejaculation, and 3 adjacent segment diseases requiring surgery.

CONCLUSION: ALIF with posterior instrumentation demonstrates excellent clinical outcomes and lordosis restoration at 2-year follow-up, with acceptable complication rates.
