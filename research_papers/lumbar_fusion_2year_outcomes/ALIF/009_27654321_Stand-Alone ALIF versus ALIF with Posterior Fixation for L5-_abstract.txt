Abstract:

OBJECTIVE: Compare outcomes of stand-alone ALIF versus ALIF with posterior fixation at L5-S1.

METHODS: Retrospective comparison of 60 patients (30 stand-alone, 30 with posterior fixation) followed for minimum 24 months.

RESULTS: Both groups improved significantly. Fusion rates: 86.7% (stand-alone) vs 96.7% (combined) (p=0.16). Stand-alone had higher subsidence rate (20% vs 3.3%, p=0.04) but shorter operative time and hospital stay. Clinical outcomes were similar at 2 years.

CONCLUSION: Stand-alone ALIF can achieve good outcomes at L5-S1 but with higher subsidence risk compared to circumferential fusion.
