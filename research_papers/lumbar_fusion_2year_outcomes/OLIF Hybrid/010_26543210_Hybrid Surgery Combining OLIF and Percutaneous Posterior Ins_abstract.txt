Abstract:

BACKGROUND: Hybrid surgery combining OLIF with percutaneous posterior instrumentation offers advantages for multilevel disease.

METHODS: 65 patients with 2-4 level degenerative disease underwent hybrid surgery. Mean 3.2 levels fused.

RESULTS: At 2 years, VAS decreased from 7.6±1.5 to 2.5±1.4, ODI from 64.2±12.1 to 22.3±10.5. Lordosis improved from 28.5±13.2° to 48.3±11.5°. Overall fusion rate 92.3%. Complications: 3 ileus, 4 thigh symptoms, 2 infections.

CONCLUSION: Hybrid OLIF technique provides good outcomes for multilevel disease with acceptable morbidity at 2-year follow-up.
