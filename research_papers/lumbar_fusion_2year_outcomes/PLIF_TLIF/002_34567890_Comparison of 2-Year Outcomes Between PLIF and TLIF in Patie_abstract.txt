Abstract:

OBJECTIVE: To compare 2-year clinical and radiological outcomes between posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for degenerative spondylolisthesis.

METHODS: 120 patients with single-level degenerative spondylolisthesis were randomized to PLIF (n=60) or TLIF (n=60). Primary outcome was ODI at 24 months. Secondary outcomes included VAS, fusion rate, operative time, blood loss, and complications.

RESULTS: Both groups showed significant improvement at 2 years. ODI improved from 62.3±11.2 to 20.1±9.8 in PLIF and from 61.8±10.9 to 19.5±9.2 in TLIF (p=0.72). Fusion rates were 93.3% (PLIF) and 95.0% (TLIF) (p=0.69). TLIF had shorter operative time (142±32 vs 168±38 min, p<0.01) and less blood loss (220±85 vs 340±120 mL, p<0.01). Dural tears occurred in 5 PLIF and 1 TLIF patient (p=0.09).

CONCLUSION: Both PLIF and TLIF provide excellent 2-year outcomes for degenerative spondylolisthesis, with TLIF showing advantages in operative time and blood loss.
