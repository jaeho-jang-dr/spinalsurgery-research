Abstract:

BACKGROUND: OLIF is a minimally invasive technique accessing the disc space through a retroperitoneal approach. This study evaluates 24-month outcomes.

METHODS: 78 patients underwent OLIF with posterior percutaneous screw fixation for degenerative disc disease. Clinical and radiological assessments were performed at regular intervals.

RESULTS: At 24 months, VAS back pain improved from 7.1±1.6 to 2.3±1.3, leg pain from 6.8±1.9 to 1.6±1.2, ODI from 56.8±11.3 to 19.2±9.1 (all p<0.001). Disc height increased from 7.8±2.3mm to 12.1±2.1mm. Fusion rate was 93.6%. Psoas weakness occurred in 8.9% but resolved within 3 months. No vascular or ureteral injuries occurred.

CONCLUSION: OLIF with posterior fixation provides excellent clinical outcomes and high fusion rates at 2-year follow-up with minimal approach-related morbidity.
