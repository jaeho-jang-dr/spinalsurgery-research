Abstract:

PURPOSE: To evaluate 2-year outcomes of lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) for adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS).

METHODS: 45 patients with ADS underwent LLIF with posterior instrumentation. Mean age was 68.2±7.3 years. Clinical outcomes (VAS, ODI, SRS-22) and radiographic parameters were assessed.

RESULTS: Coronal Cobb angle improved from 28.3±8.2° to 12.1±5.3° (p<0.001). Lumbar lordosis increased from 25.3±11.2° to 45.2±9.8° (p<0.001). VAS back pain decreased from 7.5±1.3 to 2.8±1.5, ODI from 62.1±10.5 to 24.3±11.2 (both p<0.001). SRS-22 scores improved in all domains. Fusion rate was 91.1% at 2 years. Complications included 4 transient thigh numbness, 2 hip flexor weakness, and 1 infection.

CONCLUSION: LLIF effectively corrects deformity and improves clinical outcomes in ADS patients at 2-year follow-up.
